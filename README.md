Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting bus travel time using machine learning models to enhance urban transportation planning and optimize public transit efficiency. The study evaluates different approaches, including LSTM for temporal dependencies, Hybrid LSTM + CatBoost for contextual data integration, and GBM with geospatial features for explainability. The models are assessed using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Key Features
LSTM Model: Captures temporal dependencies in bus travel times.
Hybrid Model (LSTM + CatBoost): Incorporates both sequential and contextual data for improved performance.
Explainable Model (GBM with Geospatial Features): Uses POI and topographical data to enhance interpretability.
Performance Evaluation: Models are compared based on MAE, RMSE, and MAPE to measure prediction accuracy.
